**Solutions Considered:**

1. **Naive Approach (Linear Scan):**  Reading the entire 1TB file line by line for each query is impractical.  It would be extremely slow and resource-intensive, violating the efficiency constraint.

2. **Indexing:** Creating an index of the log file based on date would significantly improve retrieval time.  This could be done using a separate index file or a database.  This approach allows for direct access to the relevant portion of the log file.

3. **Log Rotation and Compression:**  Log files are typically rotated daily or weekly. Leveraging this existing structure, combined with compression (e.g., gzip), can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned.

4. **Binary Search (with assumptions):** If the log file were perfectly sorted by date, binary search could be used.  However, with a 1TB file, even logarithmic time can be slow for the initial search.  Also, logs are unlikely to be perfectly sorted across the entire file.

**Final Solution Summary:**

The chosen solution combines log rotation and compression with a targeted linear scan.  Since logs are generated almost equally every day, we can assume a roughly uniform distribution of logs across files.  This allows us to quickly identify the relevant compressed daily log file(s) based on the input date.  We then decompress only the necessary file(s) and perform a linear scan *only within that smaller file(s)*.

This approach offers a good balance between speed and implementation complexity.  It avoids the overhead of creating and maintaining a separate index, while still providing significant performance improvement over a naive linear scan of the entire 1TB file.
